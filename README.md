### [Computer Vision Models Life-Cycle Management](https://yili808.github.io/Computer-Vision/CVLCM_with_Fiftyone_YiLi.pdf) 2021-12
Easy and efficient workflows for computer vision projects (e.g. image classification, object detection, segmentation, etc.) via open-source tools like CVAT for annotation, OpenMMLab for modeling, Fiftyone for curating data and and improving computer vision datasets and models.

Open-source tools: [Fiftyone (Voxel51)](https://voxel51.com/docs/fiftyone/), [CVAT](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/cvat), [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/)

### [Scene Text Recognition](https://yili808.github.io/Computer-Vision/Scene_Text_Recognition_YiLi.pdf) 2021-06
A technical report/research on Scence Text Detection and Recognition. 
Papers coverd in the slides: 
- Scene Text Recognition:
  - CRNN (CNN + BiLSTM + CTC loss)
  - ASTER (Spatial Transformer Networks + CNN + BiLSTM + Attention-Based Decoder)
  - MORAN (Pixel-Level Rectification + CNN + BiLSTM + Attention-Based Decoder) 
  - TextScanner (Segmentation-Based with Mutual-Supervision Mechanism)

- Scene Text Detection:
  - DB-Net: Differentiable Binarization (use segmentation-based methods for detection)

- OCR System
  - PP-OCR: A	Practical	Ultra	Lightweight	OCR	System from	Baidu	Inc. 
    
    Main idea: 1 Detector + 1 Text Box Rectifier + N Recognizer (for recognizing multiple languages).


Keywords: OCR, Scene Text Detection, Scene Text Recognition.
